# Master-Chef
Created an educational cooking app called Master Chef that teaches young adults the basic techniques and fundamentals of cooking for a high school keystone project. The app contains a basic page to learn basic cooking concepts and recipe pages to learn recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. The basic page allows the user to learn fundamental cooking concepts. On this page, the user can click on subpages and learn deeper topics of cooking such as equipment, measurements, and techniques. Each of these subpages contains video and written content that the user can learn from. Besides the educational content presented in these subpages, the subpages also contain quizzes in which the user can learn and test their knowledge further. Besides learning the fundamentals of cooking, the app also contains recipe pages that the user can turn their theoretical knowledge into practical application. There are recipe pages for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. In each of these pages, the user can select different types of recipe subpages they want to learn such as pancakes and spaghetti. These recipe subpages contain video and written instructions on what ingredients and types of equipment are needed for the recipe and the directions to make the food.
